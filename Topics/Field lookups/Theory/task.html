<h2>Field lookups</h2>
<html><body><h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>
<p>You already know how to get and filter objects from a database. Yet sometimes the logic of an application is rather complex, so you should know how to make more particular queries.</p>
<p>The exact value of a field is a good starting point, but several problems remain. How to get all objects with a field greater or less than the given value, or filter objects which fields contain some substring or even a regular expression? Here <strong>field lookups</strong> will come in handy.</p>
<h5 id="excluding-data">Excluding data</h5>
<p>The Quidditch league is gaining popularity with its new site we're making. Our users want to know the result of each game and find out some interesting statistics about the previous tournaments. We have models <em>Team</em> and <em>Game</em>. All the games from 1674 until now are stored in our database; we get them from the Hogwarts library archives. Don't even ask how much time it takes – the answer is a lot! This is why we prefer to keep the data in the database to get all the information we needed in a flash:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.db import models


class Team(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=64)


class Game(models.Model):
    home_team = models.ForeignKey(Team, related_name='game_at_home', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    home_team_points = models.IntegerField()
    rival_team = models.ForeignKey(Team, related_name='rival_game', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rival_team_points = models.IntegerField()
    date = models.DateField()</code></pre>
<p>Since we haven't published all data to the website, we shall provide you with just a sample:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from datetime import date

falmouth_falcons = Team.objects.create(name="Falmouth Falcons")
montrose_magpies = Team.objects.create(name="Montrose Magpies")
tutshill_tornados = Team.objects.create(name="Tutshill Tornados")
appleby_arrows = Team.objects.create(name="Appleby Arrows") 

Game.objects.create(home_team=falmouth_falcons, home_team_points=15,
                    rival_team=montrose_magpies, rival_team_points=12, date=date(1674, 5, 6))

Game.objects.create(home_team=falmouth_falcons, home_team_points=34,
                    rival_team=tutshill_tornados, rival_team_points=8, date=date(1774, 9, 30))

Game.objects.create(home_team=appleby_arrows, home_team_points=10,
                    rival_team=montrose_magpies, rival_team_points=19, date=date(1779, 7, 15))

Game.objects.create(home_team=tutshill_tornados, home_team_points=7,
                    rival_team=appleby_arrows, rival_team_points=27, date=date(2018, 6, 25))

Game.objects.create(home_team=montrose_magpies, home_team_points=24,
                    rival_team=tutshill_tornados, rival_team_points=16, date=date(1907, 5, 12))</code></pre>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Remember that you should migrate your models before using it!</div><p></p>
<p>If you're familiar with the <code class="language-python">filter</code> method of Django Object Manager, you'll easily follow what the <code class="language-python">exclude</code> method does. When filtering out data, we look for objects that satisfy some condition. Exclude<em>,</em> on the contrary, allows us to remove objects from QuerySet by a condition. Compare two queries:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># All home games for Falmouth Falcons
Game.objects.filter(home_team=falmouth_falcons)

# All games excluding games where Falmouth Falcons was a home team
Game.objects.exclude(home_team=falmouth_falcons)</code></pre>
<p>We break all the games into two samples: one that satisfies the condition and another that doesn't. That is the point of the <code class="language-python">exclude</code> method.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><strong>Note:</strong> the syntax rules for <code class="language-python">exclude</code> are the same as for the <code class="language-python">filter</code> method.</div><p></p>
<h5 id="field-lookups">Field Lookups</h5>
<p>Filtering objects only by their exact value is not very convenient: you might want to get objects that satisfy a trickier condition. For example, it could be all Quidditch matches of the XX century or all games where the home team scored more than 12 points. We'll start with this query:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">great_score_at_home_games = Game.objects.filter(home_team_points__gt=12)</code></pre>
<p><span style="background: transparent; color: #1c1e29;">The special syntax for the parameter is: field name, double underscores, field lookup. <strong>Field</strong></span><span style="background: transparent; color: #1c1e29;"><strong> lookup</strong> is a special name for actions on the field value you want to make when filtering data. The "<em>g</em></span><em><em style="background: transparent; color: #1c1e29;">t</em></em><span style="background: transparent; color: #1c1e29;">" lookup is a reduction of the word <em>greater,</em> so you can read this query as "filter games where the home team scored more than 12 points".</span> </p>
<p>Let's look at another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from datetime import date

twentieth_century_games = Game.objects.filter(
    date__gte=date(1900, 1, 1), date__lte=date(1999, 12, 31)
)</code></pre>
<p>The "<em>gte</em>" lookup looks similar to the "<em>gt</em>"; the difference is that "<em>gte</em>" means that the value of a field could be greater or equal than the given one. Accordingly, "<em>lte</em>" means <em>less than or equal</em>.</p>
<p>This way, we restrict the value of the date with upper and lower bounds. We could write our query with the use of another helper:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">twentieth_century_games = Game.objects.filter(date__year__gte=1900, date__year__lte=1999)</code></pre>
<p>Here we are combining two lookups. First, we extract a year from the date and then use condition on its value. The year lookup is only available for <code class="language-python">DateField</code> and <code class="language-python">DateTimeField</code>; we cannot use it for plain <code class="language-python">IntegerField</code> or <code class="language-python">CharField</code> because this wouldn't make any sense.</p>
<p>We could write our query more naturally:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">twentieth_century_games = Game.objects.filter(date__year__range=(1900, 1999))</code></pre>
<p>The syntax rule for any field lookup is simple: add double underscores before using it. When chaining them, add double underscores each time. The range means that we search values between two provided boundaries.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">It's strongly recommended not to use double underscores in field names. You should name all fields as you name all Python variables – join the parts with a single underscore mark.</div><p></p>
<h5 id="using-collections-for-lookups">Using Collections for Lookups</h5>
<p>We already know a lot about how to compare the field with a single value. Django allows us to use a collection in our queries. Of course, we can filter all home games for Falmouth Falcons and Montrose Magpies excluding all other options:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">special_home_games = Game.objects.exclude(home_team=tutshill_tornados) \
                                 .exclude(home_team=appleby_arrows)</code></pre>
<p>But what are we going to do when we have more conditions? Should we apply our profound copy-paste skills or make another smart move? We invite you to opt for the latter. Let's use the Python list to filter what we need:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">special_home_games = Game.objects.filter(home_team__in=[falmouth_falcons, montrose_magpies])</code></pre>
<p>If you're familiar with lists, you can use your knowledge for the "<em>in</em>" lookup. It works just like for any Python collection. We check that the collection contains the value, and if so, we keep the objects in our QuerySet.</p>
<h5 id="field-lookups-for-foreign-keys">Field Lookups for Foreign Keys</h5>
<p>By now you are able to filter out some data and use it for another query. First, we have <code class="language-python">falmouth_falcons</code> as a variable. Then we can filter the games where Falcons was a home team. But do we need to store it in a variable to make a query? It's not necessary because we can access fields of foreign keys directly through lookups.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">falcons_home_games = Game.objects.filter(home_team__name="Falmouth Falcons")</code></pre>
<p>You use double underscores again and it works. Now the construction is: foreign key field name, double underscores, foreign key model field.</p>
<p>To dive deeper, let's combine accessing the field of the foreign model with field lookups:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">falcons_home_games = Game.objects.filter(home_team__name__contains="Falcons")</code></pre>
<p>Double underscores are similar to access through the dot, fields are similar to class attributes and lookups resemble class methods. So you can combine them just like you can combine accesses through the dot.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Be careful and don't make too complex queries with many double underscores: two pairs are enough. If you use more, the time can dramatically increase or your database will use a lot of memory for that query.</div><p></p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Once you learn how to get particular objects, you quickly become dexterous in your queries. Using field lookups you can apply methods to fields of models or even those of foreign keys. It looks like we can get any objects we could think of! Surely, there's always room for perfection and more knowledge, so you may check out more lookups in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/models/querysets/#field-lookups" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official documentation</a>.</p></body></html>
